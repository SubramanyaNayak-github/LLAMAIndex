right so\\nI'm from my distance\\n[Music]\\nrole of degree while raising funds for\\nyour startup not applicable does no for\\nyou guys right\\n[Laughter]\\ncrazy thing so\\nyeah tell us crazy things\\nI still remember one One Vision list was\\nvery um candid with us at all that they\\nwere talking to us for two years uh very\\ngood guys this guy told me like we\\nreally like you guys you're doing\\namazing things except all of that but\\nyou know that you guys are not pedigree\\nright\\nbecause it was after a lot of meetings I\\nfelt so bad saying that\\nI think if I understand from the the\\ninvestors perspective and they're also\\nhuman being right so maybe it's very\\neasy to sort of take a call like\\nsomebody's from IIT I mean I mean I'll\\nsay that you're an outlier right you are\\nan outlier of outliers so you're right\\nfrom that point of view it's it's very\\nweird and stuff to go out and bet on not\\nthe usual right yeah you have enough IIT\\nand building something yeah Etc yeah but\\nthat also differentiates from good\\ninvestors to Great investors\\nfrom IIT then work in shop101 then in 3D\\nthen in bikai right so all funded\\nstartup group and then you raise in 2021\\nright\\nnice so I think it was easier to sort of\\nget access to that Network and talk to\\nlike select pieces I really want to talk\\nand also I think\\na lot of seniors working in vce so they\\nsort of come in as an inbound want to\\nknow more about what you're building I\\nthink that visit was very easy but the\\nonly challenge with degree was key\\nengineering degree I'm building\\nsomething\\nfinances like what is it that you know\\nwhat Finance you don't have a fintech\\nbackground you don't have an MBA but in\\ngeneral it was easier I think than what\\nVivek and sanchit said I think at least\\nmeet them\\nforeign\\nbut still in terms of my portfolio\\ninvestment my second highest across all\\nmy savings so yeah beats all the other\\nthings but I think I think the summary\\nof this is that if you are a non iitn\\nfounder I mean\\nright but if you are an owner\\nso if you're an honor 18 founder then\\nthey will focus\\nlike I mean somebody connected you\\nsomebody connected me as well right so\\nconsciously subconsciously do you care\\nabout pedigree if somebody is asking you\\nfor Angel\\nlike in MJ I've put in small money is\\nnot true because he is a big my\\nco-founder and Dubai my co-founder they\\nwork closely right so they said yeah I\\nmust be in the airport\\nbut you got referral about the guy\\nthough you didn't meet the guy you got\\nthe difference yeah the guy is important\\nbut their Network effect comes in that\\npedigree comes like I got to know MJ's\\nfrom IIT yesterday I usually definitely\\nthat has not been in my criteria at all\\nbecause I met equally dumb people from\\nID right and I've seen they're giving up\\nmore quickly uh jumping to our next\\nthing Etc that so for me\\nit actually I think more because I know\\nthat most of the capital they've raised\\nis because of the IIT and inm has come\\nat very early stages I know that who\\nelse is investing doesn't matter because\\nmost of them are interesting because the\\nIIT senior Junior whatever right and I\\nusually talk to the founder to\\nunderstand\\ncucarach as in why right because I've\\nseen that\\nmost of the where I thought someone was\\ninvested so let me invest\\nwe know that it will go nowhere\\nbasically ID guys probably I feel that\\nwill give up more quickly no I've\\nactually seen that no I think all right\\nI'll tell you why that pressure comes\\nbecause the opportunity cost is high\\nyeah\\npoint of view yeah\\nsee the founder is right for him he's\\nnot working out he has that safety net\\nhe knows that time I'll get more money\\nfrom this point of it's all right but\\nfrom our University but but I have a\\npoint here if you think about\\nopportunity cost no you will never be\\nable to build a good startup yeah no I\\ncompletely agree\\ndo you have any biases while hiring\\nlike especially in Tech roles obviously\\nsummer rolls you would have but like\\nlet's say core technology architecture\\nyeah I've actually seen the craziest of\\nThe Tech Guys we who build best of the\\nsystems Etc you're born again really\\nreally fast right and really fast and we\\nhave built amazing Tech uh things to\\nmake things work etc and I've seen uh\\nwhile IIT guys also did well Etc we had\\nlike two three uh leaders from non-iit\\nMalad College of Engineering because my\\ncousins were for me that was one network\\nwhich are there and um they built\\namazing systems and they hired the best\\nof the people at lowest cost because\\nthey had access to that network of uh\\nEngineers correct who are not iitns and\\nnot shopping around to everything right\\npeople who are not from it they were\\nthey are very they want to make makeup\\nfor it yeah yeah so that yeah people\\nlike us\\nwhat are Indians Miss is the real Indian\\nHustle\\nI personally feel it but we don't sort\\nof understand things that are happening\\non the ground is it yeah I personally\\nfeel it might be different from others\\nopinions why what what makes it uh\\ndifferently because of the safety net\\nright we always feel here\\nright there's that soft cushion always\\nsomething or the other I believe it\\ngives a head start for a good career in\\nthe beginning but that doesn't last for\\nlong then you'll have to eventually\\nprovide in the first couple of stains\\nyeah personally I am biased for uh\\npeople who come from reference so and\\nthey can be familiarity they can be from\\nany other college just realize we're\\ntalking that\\neach protect person in my team is from\\nIIT they were just like they're only\\nHardy I think around 18 people all good\\nfolks all good folks nice we should keep\\nin mind\\nand this is not something which we\\nconsciously sort of did but I think it\\nhappened yeah only that Network I mean\\nyeah everyone is a junior junior\\nimpact of college network on your\\nentrepreneurial Journey it's all\\nself-built Network right\\nI don't think who's running as company\\nor who is in VC yeah so it was it's hard\\nbut luckily my brother is from IIT Delhi\\nof course I had to leverage my brother's\\nNetwork you had family there yeah yeah\\n[Music]\\nand now you know two smart lecturers you\\nknow two smartphones probably seniors\\nthat you can get connected to right and\\nprobably someone in your family two\\nthree guys right that is your network of\\nsmartest people that you can think right\\nhere you said 900 people right so out of\\n900 people even ten percent\\nyou can understand thesis on every\\nindustry that you had ideas about pros\\nand cons\\nof that right so you'd have some VC\\nfriends who will tell you he's my fun\\nMillions\\nmine is a very unique case so I\\ngraduated from it I was from the first\\nbatch so no seniors so you are the\\nsenior for everyone\\none thing guys like\\nlike did you have any imposter syndrome\\nand how did you get over it no wow for\\nme the biggest fear was when we were\\nscaling 2018 2019 I still remember when\\nwe are hiring from because of the\\ncolleges outside India Etc like that\\nit's all fancy colleges no they're like\\nHBO and um but\\nI went off very quickly also so we\\nrealized that greatest of the problems\\nattracted best of the capital and best\\nof the people so that was our strength\\nwe were solving one of the most\\ncomplicated things so everything was\\neasy relatively the only challenge that\\nmight come in raising money a little bit\\nthere also we have some accessibility to\\npeople who have who we have worked with\\nin the past it's all fair I mean\\ncustomer doesn't ask from which college\\nyou are really yeah so nobody cares I\\nmean unless you are providing them good\\nvalue so that's not a problem yeah\\nexpectations from your child to do IIT\\nslash iam\\nit's a very interesting question I'll\\nanswer first I don't go for it you know\\nwhy it's totally up to him like yeah\\none one nice so you want him to be IIT I\\ncan see that hasn't it\\nactually I know that kind of expectation\\nis wrong but I want him to do whatever\\nhe does he should be at the top is my\\nbut I want my kid to chill as an uh and\\nnot go through all the over a\\nperiod of time you realize none of this\\nmatters why doesn't we are trying to\\nprove ourselves see most of the things\\nwe do is to challenge ourselves and all\\nof that right and eventually you will be\\nlike TK right that is the phase you get\\ntwo weeks at all that so I think you\\nshould just let the kid be and probably\\nI will try that experiment hopefully my\\nwife will agree to all of that but even\\na choice\\nyeah because it's not easy\\nit's not easy to convince your wife on a\\nlot of things so imagine the IIT safety\\nnet that you had right the freedom for\\nyou to do anything came from IIT right\\nbut if it didn't come from parent so\\nimagine telling indicate that you go do\\nwhatever you want and all of this\\ndoesn't matter anyways you have your\\nnetwork right you can always get that\\nNetwork to your kid in some fashion but\\ngiving that flexibility and freedom for\\nthem to explore whatever they want to do\\nin life if you like let your kid be\\nhe'll be exam photo like he'll probably\\njust be happy probably you can just be\\nmedia current and still be happy the\\nfear there is key what if he gets into\\nsomething wrong things those yeah you\\nshould see there if you can educate\\nright yeah see that's a different thing\\nthat's a very different see that can\\nhappen even if you push him to the best\\nof the college right\\nyeah I think my understanding from this\\nis right up our parents they came from\\nlike a very very Scottish background\\nthey were like\\nat least our kids they are growing in a\\nvery uh in a very different India right\\nso I will be happy to make my kid a\\nbadminton player if he's he or she is\\ngood at that right so yeah\\nsuggestions for employees who wants to\\nbe a founder so we have lot of employees\\nwho become great Founders yeah I know\\nlike there's bounce Mafia kind of thing\\nyeah actually and they're doing well I\\nthink one thing they've realized is if\\nthese guys can do it we can also do it\\nis also the comfort that we're given\\nthem why you want to regret later that\\nyou didn't try right so go out and try\\nas long as personally you have buffer to\\ntry out 12 months of no money no salary\\nand uh your family is going to support\\nand you have those basic things covered\\nyeah yeah definitely go and try that is\\none of the things that you should go out\\nand try and figure it out for yourself\\nare you cut out for it or not and like\\nnobody tell you that you're cut out to\\nbe a founder or not one thing which\\nwhich is common in all the

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 12] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 29,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [31, 21, 13].\\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random.

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstatesht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [ 18] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,16]. In all but a few cases [ 22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [ 15] and ConvS2S [ 8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers.

We employ a residual connection [ 10] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2).

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=∑dk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), withxi,zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 17] withβ1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5,step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop= 0.1.\\n7', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The conﬁguration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
